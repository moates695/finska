## Finska Rules 

### Objective

Be the first player (or team) to score exactly 50 points.

### Equipment

12 numbered pins (1–12) — arranged in a tight formation (usually a 3–4–5 triangle).

Throwing log (“finska” or “mölkky”) — a small wooden baton used to knock over pins.

### Setup

Stand the pins upright in the formation about 3–4 meters from the throwing line.

Players take turns throwing the log underhand from behind the line.

### Scoring

If one pin falls: you score the number on that pin.
(e.g., hit only the 12 → 12 points)

If multiple pins fall: you score the number of pins knocked over.
(e.g., hit 4 pins → 4 points)

Pins must fall completely (tilt doesn’t count).

After each throw, stand the fallen pins upright exactly where they landed — so the formation gradually spreads out.

Throws must be underhand only.

### Going Over 50

If your score goes above 50, your total is reset to 25.

### Misses

A miss = no pins knocked over.

Three consecutive misses → you’re out.

### App Rule Modifications

- Change the target score
- Change the reset score
- Disable eliminations from misses
- Change miss count before elimination
- Continue playing after someone has won
- Allow eliminated players back in manually or after sitting out throws or turns
